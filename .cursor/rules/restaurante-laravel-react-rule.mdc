# Restaurant Laravel React Project Rules

## Documentation and Sources

- Always use official documentation and/or certified sources.
- Always use the official documentation for React 19, Laravel 12, and Inertia.js 2.0.
- Always verify information before implementing it.

## Best Practices

- Always follow programming best practices.
- Maintain clean, readable, and well-structured code.
- Apply SOLID principles and appropriate design patterns.

## Technology Stack

### Backend
- Programming language: PHP 8.2
- Framework: Laravel 12
- Frontend integration: Inertia.js 2.0

### Frontend
- Framework: React 19
- Backend integration: Inertia.js 2.0

## General Considerations

- Verify compatibility between versions of the technologies used.
- Prioritize official and documented solutions over third-party solutions.
- Maintain code consistency and follow project standards.

## Commit Message Convention

Always use **Conventional Commits** format for commit messages:

### Format

```
<type>(<scope(optional)>): <short description>

<detailed description(optional)>
```

### Types

- **feat**: New features in the code
- **fix**: Bug fixes ONLY
- **refactor**: Code structure improvements (code readability, simplify complex logic, remove duplicate code, change file structure, update syntax to new standards)
- **perf**: Performance improvements (such as optimized queries)
- **chore**: Dependency updates, changes in .gitignore and configuration files (such as .env)
